This project was designed for the UC Davis Fullstack Web Development Program. It has been deployed to GitHub pages at the following link:



## Summary

* HTML, CSS, and Javascript was used to create a coding quiz. The quiz has a timer of 60 seconds and any incorrect guesses will result in a penalty of 10 seconds to that time. After the quiz ends you have the option to save your highscore and initials. These inputs are stored locally. 

## Execution

* Click the "Start Quiz" button to begin
* When prompted with a question, select the correct answer by clicking on the list option
* After the quiz finishes you can enter your initials to be stored along with your score
* These highscores can be accessed from the homepage by clicking the "view highscores" link
* You can clear the highscores from the same page. A prompt will load for a second confirmation.
